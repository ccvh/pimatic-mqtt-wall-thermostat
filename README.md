# pimatic-mqtt-wall-thermostat
An ESP32 / ePaper Wall Thermostat for use with MQTT Broker / pimatic

# What is this?
It's an little Arduino script for an esp32 / 8266 chip, which get's room temperature and thermostat setpoint from an mqtt broker. Via push buttons, changes can be done. 

# Why?
I'm using pimatic (https://pimatic.org/) combined with the AVM Dect "Smart" Thermostat devices. As the fritz! DECT is not as smart as i want them to be, and i really don't like the app, i wanted to create a possibility to control them from a wall panel.

# What do i need?
- Raspberry Pi / Pimatic and any kind of pimatic-supported thermostat for your heater. 
- ESP32
- A display. I use the 1.54" ePaper Display from waveshare
- Some Buttons
- A case
- PCB / Breadboard
